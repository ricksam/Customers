1. About this software
    This package includes the following two software programs to use with an EPSON TM series printer.

    1) Windows Printer Driver
        This driver is a Windows Printer Driver for the TM printer.
        This driver makes it possible to print from a Windows application.

    2) StatusAPI
        StatusAPI is a program that works in conjunction with the TM printer driver.
        It offers an Application Program Interface for obtaining the printer status 
        whether or not the printer is printing.  This API makes integrating printer
        status handling functions with applications more simple.

        For detailed information, please see each reference manual.

2. Supplied Files
    - APD_501_T20_EWM.zip  : Printer Driver, StatusAPI installer with manuals

    Refer to the installation manual APD5_Install_E_RevB.pdf.


3. Remarks
    1) For detailed information, please read each manual that is created by the installation
       APD5_MAN_T20_EN_A.exe.

    2) When an error message is displayed during installation, the following procedure may enable to
       recover from the error.
       1) Specify the uninstall option, and execute the installer "APD_501_T20.exe /uninstall".
       2) Remove the error factor.
       3) Execute the installer "APD_501_T20.exe".

    3) Characters may not be printed correctly when using Easy Print of Windows Server 2008.
       For detailed information of this problem arising from the operating system,
       see the following web page provided by Microsoft Corporation.
       http://support.microsoft.com/kb/946411/

    4) In the Easy Print environment of Windows Server 2008, you cannot print the printer device font
       directly.
       However, you can print the device font converted from the True Type font by using
       "Font Substitution" of APD.
       For more information, see "Character Printing (Device Font)" in Printer Manual.

    5) When using Terminal Service and Remote Desktop, interactive communication becomes unavailable
       between the PC and the printer, prohibiting displaying the printer status and obtaining printer
       information using the Status API.

    6) The port redirection function is unavailable for a client when using Terminal Service or
       Remote Desktop.

    7) At times, the status of the shared printer may not be displayed correctly or the Status API may not
       be opened.
       These problems arise from the security policy settings of the operating system.
       Although changing the settings of the operating system is possible by the following steps, it lowers
       the security policy.
       (1) Go to [Start] - [Administrative tool] - [Local Security Policy].
       (2) [Security Option] - [Network Access (Set "Limit anonymous sccesses to the named pipe and shared
           printer" to "Invalid".)]
       However, you do not have to change the settings when a client PC is connected to the domain
       environment and when the same user name as a user name that is logged on a client is existing."

    8) Please use the same version of EPSON Advanced Printer Driver for each host when a network printer
       is shared among two or more hosts.
